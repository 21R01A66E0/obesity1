    <div class="ul">
        <h2>1. Consult a Healthcare Professional</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical Evaluation: Ensure there are no underlying medical conditions causing the underweight issue, such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or gastrointestinal disorders.</li>
            <br><li>Nutritionist/Dietitian: Work with a specialist to create a personalized nutrition plan. </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>2. Balanced Diet</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Calorie-Dense Foods: Incorporate high-calorie foods like nuts, seeds, avocados, and whole grains.</li>
            <br><li>Frequent Meals: Eat several small meals throughout the day to increase calorie intake.</li>
            <br><li>Protein-Rich Foods: Include lean meats, dairy products, eggs, and legumes to build muscle mass.</li>
            <br><li>Healthy Fats: Integrate healthy fats like olive oil, nut butters, and fatty fish.</li>
            <br><li>Complex Carbohydrates: Consume whole grains, starchy vegetables, and legumes for sustained energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><h2>3. Nutritional Supplements </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Protein Shakes and Supplements: Consider protein shakes or meal replacement shakes if you have trouble meeting calorie needs through food alone.</li>
            <br><li>Multivitamins: Ensure you're getting essential vitamins and minerals, especially if you have dietary restrictions.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <br><h2>4. Exercise Routine</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strength Training: Engage in weight lifting and resistance exercises to build muscle mass.</li>
            <br><li>Cardio in Moderation: Limit excessive cardiovascular exercises that can burn too many calories.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><h2>5. Healthy Habits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular Eating Schedule: Stick to regular meal times and avoid skipping meals.</li>
            <br><li>Adequate Hydration: Drink plenty of water, but avoid drinking large amounts right before meals to prevent feeling full quickly.</li>
            <br><li>Sleep: Ensure you get sufficient rest, as sleep is crucial for muscle repair and overall health.</li>
        </ul >
        <br><h2>6. Mental Health</h2>
